## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

In exploring the listings data for Airbnb in San Francisco, we hope to find interesting relationships between the price of a rental unit and other variables in the dataset, such as neighborhood, number of beds and baths, and whether or not the host is classified as a super host. We could also look for interesting relationships with the review scores. Using the results of our analysis, we could give advice to people who are interested in renting out their homes, which would allow them to charge higher prices or gain higher ratings. Our insights could also be relevant to people who want to purchase properties as investments, because we could tell them which factors are most strongly correlated with rental prices, booking rates and customer satisfaction. If there is time, I think it would be very interesting to search the titles and descriptions of listing to find keywords that are associated with higher ratings or rental prices.
